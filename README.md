# MemoryGame
Welcome to Memory Game. This is a simple memory game created from html, css, and javascript. 

## How to Play
When the page loads, you are gifted with a 4x4 of cards. The game, and the timer, starts when you click on your first square. From there, gind the match to the card. Do this until all the cards have been turned over. When a match is made, the cards flash green. When the cards don't match, they flash red and turn back over. The game counts the number of moves you make until all the cards have been matched, at which time the timer will stop. Once finished, a popup will appear with the total number of moves you made, how much time it took, and a "Play Again?" button. If at any point during your game you want to reset the cards, there is a reset arrow next to the timer. 
How good is your memory?
